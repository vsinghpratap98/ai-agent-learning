🤖 What is Hugging Face?
Hugging Face is a company and open-source community that builds and hosts powerful tools for machine learning, especially natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, speech, and now agents and LLMs.

It's like the GitHub of AI models.

🔑 Core Offerings
1. 🧠 Transformers Library
The most popular Python library for using pre-trained models:

Load GPT, BERT, T5, LLaMA, etc.

Use them for text generation, translation, Q&A, summarization, etc.
/*
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
generator("The future of AI is", max_length=50)
*/

2. 🏬 Model Hub
A huge online repository of 500,000+ pre-trained models.

Upload, download, or fine-tune models easily.

Example: https://huggingface.co/models

3. 📂 Datasets Hub
Ready-to-use datasets for training, testing, and fine-tuning models.

NLP, image, audio, and multimodal datasets.

4. ⚙️ Spaces
Free hosting for AI demos and apps using:

Gradio (easy UI tool)

Streamlit

Docker

Great for deploying AI agents or models online without needing your own server.

👉 Example: https://huggingface.co/spaces

5. 🧠 Inference API
Use models via API calls without installing anything.

Hugging Face hosts the models and computes predictions for you.
